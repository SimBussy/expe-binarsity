# Experiments for Binarsity: a penalization for one-hot encoded features

This is the main code used in the experiments of the paper entitled "Binarsity: a penalization for one-hot encoded features" 
available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08619) and accepted for publication in [JMLR](http://www.jmlr.org/). 

To re-use this code, you must install _tick_, a Python 3 module for statistical learning available [here](https://x-datainitiative.github.io/tick/), and replace all _mlpp_ occurences by _tick_ (modulo some updates).
